# DATA-440
Repository for my Data Science capstone class (DATA 440) at William and Mary, taught by Professor Daniel Vasiliu. Contains multiple projects as well as the final capstone project and paper. Can turn into a github site using the html and css (Can't do it using this github since I already have one hosted).
